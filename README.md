# TS-Task-Manager

TS-Task-Manager is a basic CLI task-manager application written in TypeScript.  My intent for writing this app was to practice TypeScript, and to get familiar with NPMs readlineSync package.

Once the application has been started, users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks using the readlineSync.question prompts in the terminal.
